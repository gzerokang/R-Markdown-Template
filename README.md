# R-Markdown-Template

This is a sample using R Markdown to generate reports in the form of the two-column ASA template. Latex is nice, but you still will have to keep track of all figures and tables yourself.  With R Markdown, you will be able to compile your entire exam paper with one button (or two,  ctrl+b, if you use Sublime Text).
